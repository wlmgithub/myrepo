Liming, need a script that could do the following:

--check disk usage of /export/content once per hour on all machines in a particular environment, for a number of hours defined on command line
--store this data somewhere for analysis

kind of like the netstat script.  idea is I would run this during a perf run by Badri and look at places where disk usage gets near limit.  we could then expand disks on these hosts, look at why these services log so much etc.

let me know if questions.
